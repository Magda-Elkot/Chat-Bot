# Chat Bot for Psychotherapy using Machine Learning
    Welcome to my project! As part of my work at SYNC INTERN'S, I created a Chat Bot for Psychotherapy using 
    Machine Learning. The aim of this project is to provide a cost-effective 
    and accessible way for people to seek mental health support.

# Project Overview
  The project includes the following steps:

    1. Load a dataset of questions and answers using Pandas.
    2. Clean the data by removing unnecessary characters and stopwords using NLTK.
    3. Convert the text into a numerical representation using TfidfVectorizer.
    4. Train a machine learning model using cosine similarity.
    5. Test the chatbot by providing inputs and getting responses.

# Getting Started
  To get started with the chatbot, you will need to have the following:

    Python 3.6 or higher
    Jupyter Notebook
    Pandas
    NLTK
    Scikit-learn

    You can install the required libraries using the following command:
      pip install pandas nltk scikit-learn

# Running the Chatbot
  To run the chatbot, follow these steps:

    1. Load the dataset of questions and answers.
    2. Clean the dataset by removing unnecessary characters and stopwords.
    3. Convert the text into a numerical representation using TfidfVectorizer.
    4. Train a machine learning model using cosine similarity.
    5.Test the chatbot by providing inputs and getting responses.

# Conclusion
  I hope you find this chatbot useful for providing mental health support. 
  If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement, please let me know!
